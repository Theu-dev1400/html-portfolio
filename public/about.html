<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Matheus, I am a Computer Science student from Brazil and passionate about technology, programming, and innovation. I am constantly seeking new learning opportunities and challenges that allow me to grow both professionally and personally.</p>

<p>Even though I’m at the beginning of my studies, I am already becoming familiar with basic concepts and starting to explore HTML and CSS, which are essential tools for building and styling web pages. I’m highly motivated to keep improving and to apply what I’ve been learning in simple academic and personal projects.</p>

<p>I believe in the power of continuous learning and I’m committed to growing in the tech field with dedication and curiosity. This portfolio represents the beginning of my journey — and I’m excited about everything that’s still to come.</p>
